#just assignment for cs193p
I find i'm so **weak** for programming.Also the English.But as the old people says,God reward those who work hard.Consequently,I try to be a excellent programmer.

I really need a designer to work together who also want to do soming fucking awesome iOS app or game.

ehhh,I don't know what to markdown,so I write a SongCi(a kind of Chinese poems).


洞仙歌
------------
**冰肌玉骨，自清凉无汗。水殿风来暗香满。绣帘开，一点明月窥人；人未寝，倚枕钗横鬓乱。**

**起来携素手，庭户无声，时见疏星度河汉。试问夜如何？夜已三更，金波淡，玉绳低转。但屈指西风几时来，又不道流年暗中偷换。**
